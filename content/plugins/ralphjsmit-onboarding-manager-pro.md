This package allows you to design beautiful and fully integrated onboarding experiences for Filament Admin. Make it painless for your users to start using your app or SaaS and prevent them from dropping off. The package provides easy syntax inspired by the [Spatie's and Caleb Porzio's Laravel Onboard](https://github.com/laravel-onboard).

**New: Package includes Filament V3 support!**

[**Upgrading from V1 to V2?**](#upgrading-from-v1-to-v2)

### Features

- Prevent users from accessing Filament without first completing required parts of your onboarding.
- Add optional onboarding steps with the beautiful dashboard widget.
- Guide your users through one or multiple [wizards](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/forms/layout#wizard).💫
- Redirect users to links (e.g. for an OAuth-process) or guide them through a multi-step wizard.
- Let users complete actions straight from the dashboard using Filament actions (**NEW**). 
- Allow users to skip actions (**NEW**).
- Beautiful design & integration with Filament Admin.
- Advanced widget design with native support for columns and column spans.
- Support for dark mode. 🌚
- Can be easily translated with a language file.
– Redirect to custom route after completing onboard flow.

### Screenshots

#### OAuth flow

You redirect users to a link. This is very handy for authorizing OAuth flows. Without completing this step, you users will not be able to access the dashboard.

#### Wizard

You can require users to complete one or multiple forms in a wizard. This is very useful for creating records and collecting required information. Your users will not be able to access the dashboard before completing the wizard either.

#### Widget (simple design)

You can use the dashboard widget to nudge your users into completing certain steps. In this phase, your users will already have access to the dashboard.

#### Widget (advanced design)

The widget is responsive and you can create very advanced designs with it. It uses the same technique as the native [Grid](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/forms/layout#grid) component in Filament.

#### Widget (compact design, less space between widgets)

There is also an option to reduce the space between the cards in the widget if that looks better to you:

#### Dark mode

There's also full support for a gorgeous dark mode:

#### Custom theme

The plugin integrates with any custom theme and of course the default theme. Here's an example of how the widget looks on the default theme:

# Installation guide: Beautiful onboarding experiences with Filament Admin

Thank you for purchasing the Onboarding Manager Pro plugin for Filament Admin!

We tried to make the library as **easy-to-install** and **versatile** as possible. Nevertheless, if you still have a **question or a feature request**, please send an e-mail to **support@ralphjsmit.com**.

In this guide I'll show you **how to install the library**, so you **can start using it right away**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

For these installation instructions to work, you'll need to have the [Filament Admin](https://filament-admin.com) package installed and configured.

The package is supported on both Laravel 8 and 9. Please be aware though that support for security fixes for Laravel 8 ends within a few months.

### Installation via Composer

To install the package you should add the package to your `composer.json` file in the `repositories` key:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://filament-onboarding-manager-pro.composer.sh"
        }
    ]
}

```

Next, you should require the package via the command line. You will be prompted for your username (which is your e-mail) and your password (which is your license key plus a colon ':' + the domain on which you activated it, e.g. `8c21df8f-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723ef500:mydomain.com`).

```shell
composer require ralphjsmit/laravel-filament-onboard
```

After purchasing the plugin, you'll also be shown installation instructions with the appropriate credentials pre-filled.

Optionally, you can publish the config file.

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-onboard-config"
```

### Configuring the plugin per-panel (Filament V3)

If you are using the plugin in Filament V3, you should register the plugin in each of the panels that you have in your project and would like to use the media library in:

```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\FilamentOnboard;

$panel
    ->plugin(FilamentOnboard::make()) 
```

In the rest of the documentation, if you see any code examples that use the `$panel` variable, it will refer to this variable in the panel service provider for each of the panels that you register the plugin in.

In the rest of the docs, if we refer to the `$plugin` variable, then we mean the `$plugin = FilamentOnboard::make()`. This is not necessarily a variable, but it helps to keep the code examples shorter and simpler.

Therefore, the following code examples mean the same:

```php
$plugin
    ->prefix('welcome')
    ->someOtherMethod();
```

```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\FilamentOnboard;

$panel
    ->plugin(
        FilamentOnboard::make()
            ->prefix('welcome')
            ->someOtherMethod()
    ) 
```

### Add plugin Blade files to your custom theme `tailwind.config.js` (required)

Since this plugin registers new HTML, you need to make sure that the Tailwind CSS classes are generated. New in Filament V3 is that you need to create a custom theme in order to include CSS from plugins (in order to keep your panel as fast as possible). If you do not follow this step, you risk that the plugin pages/designs look weird, because CSS is missing.

First, make sure you are [using a custom theme](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/themes) for every panel that you want to use the media library in. Please check that you registered your theme in your panel provider(s) using `$panel->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/{nameOfTheme}/theme.css`)` for Vite or the method for Mix specified in the create theme command output.

Next, you'll need to instruct Tailwind to also purge the view-files for the media library. Add the following key to the `content` key of the `tailwind.config.js` file **for each of the themes you use the media library in**:

```js
content: [
    // Your other files
   './vendor/ralphjsmit/laravel-filament-onboard/resources/**/*.blade.php',
],
```

> NB. The `tailwind.config.js` you need to add this line to is not a possible `tailwind.config.js` file in your root project, but only in the `resources/css/filament/{nameOfTheme}/tailwind.config.js` file(s) of your theme(s).

## Usage

Configuring your onboarding is very simple. First, I'll show you how to configure the widget. Next, I'll show you how to prevent users from accessing the dashboard without completing certain onboarding and how to make wizards

### Technical details

It might be handy to know a little bit about how the package works. Two important concepts here are **tracks** and **steps**. Each track is a series of steps that a user has to complete. Your application typically has one or two tracks: one track for outside the admin panel and one track for the widget.

You can determine yourself using a closure when a step is viewed as "complete". If all steps in a track are complete, the whole track is deemed complete as well.

### Creating a track
                     
The place to create a track is in the `panel()` methods of each panel service provider that you want to use the plugin in. 

Create a track using the `$plugin->addTrack()` method.

```php
$plugin
    ->addTrack(fn () => Track::make([
        /** Your steps */
    ]),
```

**Please make sure that you put the `fn() => ` before the `Track::make()` part, so that the argument is a closure instead of a direct. Otherwise, the logic in the plugin will be executed too early and it will throw an error.** 

### Adding steps to a track

Next, you can **add steps** to a track by adding an array with steps. Create a single step by using the `Step::make()` method.

When using the admin widget, each step is represented by a nice card (see the images above).

The `Step::make()` method accepts two parameters:

1. The name of the step. This name is displayed to the user.
2. A unique identifier for the step. This identifier should be a string and is unique in your complete application.

```php
Track::make([
    Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
        /** Other configuration for the step... */
])
```

You can also provide a name using a closure:

```php
Step::make(name: fn () => 'Hello ' . auth()->user()->first_name, identifier: 'greeting')
```

#### Adding a description

You can add a description for the step by adding the `->description()` method. Provide either a string, an `HtmlString` or a closure.

```php
Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
    ->description('Sign in with Notion and grant access to your workspace.')
```

#### Adding an icon

You can add an icon (as string or as closure that returns string) to the step by using the `->icon()` method:

```php
Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-check-circle')
```

#### Setting a color

You can set the color of the icon using the `->color()` method. The default is `primary`.

```php
Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-check-circle')
    ->color('info')
```

#### Adding a url or action

Each Step can have a button at the bottom of the page. This button can either be a link/url or an advanced Filament action, including things like modals or forms.

You can use the `->url()` method to add a link to the step. Combine this method with the `performStepActionLabel()` to define the label that should be on the button. 

The link will be displayed to the user. You can use this to redirect to an OAuth provider or to a specific page in the dashboard:

```php
Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
    ->performStepActionLabel('Add workspace →')
    ->url(route('callbacks.notion.authorize'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
```

Alternatively, you can modify the `performStepAction()` to include any advanced code. This can include a modal or a form or any other PHP action that you want to run.

For example, this is an action that would open the "notifications" slide-over using Livewire:

```php
Step::make(name: 'Notifications overview', identifier: 'open-notifications')
  ->performStepAction(function (Action $action) {
      return $action
        ->label('Open notifications overview')
        ->action(function (OnboardTrackWidget $livewire) {
            $livewire->dispatch('open-modal', id: 'database-notifications');
        });
  })
```

#### Determining if a step is complete

You can use the `->completeIf()` method to specify a closure that will determine whether this step is complete. This closure should return a boolean:

```php
Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
    ->completeIf(fn () => auth()->user()->workspaces()->exists())
```

#### Allowing users to skip actions (NEW)

You can now also allow your users to skip a certain step. You can do this by providing a closure to the `skippable()` method. Below is an example of how this logically might work together:

```php
Step::make(name: 'Notifications overview', identifier: 'open-notifications')
  ->completeIf(function ()  {
    return auth()->user()->onboarding_notifications_completed;
  })
  ->skippable(function ()  {
      auth()->user()->onboarding_notifications_completed = true;
      auth()->user()->save();
  })
  ->performStepAction(function (Action $action) {
      return $action
        ->label('Open notifications overview')
        ->action(function (OnboardTrackWidget $livewire) {
            $livewire->dispatch('open-modal', id: 'database-notifications');
            
            auth()->user()->onboarding_notifications_completed = true;
            auth()->user()->save();
        });
  })
```

By default, a user will be prompted with a model to confirm that they indeed want to skip the test. You can customize the modal details with the `->skipStepActionLabel()`, `->skipStepActionModalHeading()` and `->skipStepActionModalDescription()` methods:

```php
$step
    ->skipStepActionLabel('Skip notifications')
    ->skipStepActionModalHeading('Are you sure you want to skip this step?')
    ->skipStepActionModalDescription('Your notifications will always still arrive in your overview.')
```

#### Adding a column span

You can use the `->columnSpan()` method to specify how many columns wide the card should be. You can use the `Onboard::addTrack(/** Your steps */)->columns(/** Nr of columns */)` to specify how many columns there should be in total.

You can even use an array to make the design responsive. It uses the same technique as the native [Grid](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/forms/layout#grid), so you can use the same techniques here.

```php
Track::make([
    Step::make(/** */)
        ->columnSpan(['default' => 1, 'md' => 1, 'lg' => 2, ])
        // Other steps..
    ])
    ->columns(['default' => 1, 'md' => 3, 'lg' => 6, ])
```

Cards will automatically wrap to the next row.

The final result might look something like this:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\FilamentOnboard;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->default()
        ->id('admin')
        ->path('admin')
        // Other panel configuration...
        ->plugin(
            FilamentOnboard::make()
                ->addTrack(fn () => Track::make([
                    Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
                        ->description('Sign in with Notion and grant access to your workspace.')
                        ->icon('heroicon-o-check-circle')
                        ->performStepActionLabel('Add workspace →')
                        ->url(route('callbacks.notion.authorize'))
                        ->completeIf(fn () => auth()->user()->workspaces()->exists())
                        ->columnSpan(1),
                    // Other steps
                    // Step::make(/** */)...
                    // Step::make(/** */)...
                ])->columns(3)      
              )
        );
}
```

#### Display the widget more compact

You can chain the `->compact()` method to the track that you created in order to make the design more compact.

### Using the widget

Now that we have defined our steps, we can register the widget class to use on the dashboard. You can also use the widget on resources and pages.

The widget class is `RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Widgets\OnboardTrackWidget`.

You can register the widget by via a panel service provider:

```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Widgets\OnboardTrackWidget;

$panel
    ->widgets([
        OnboardTrackWidget::class,    
  ])
```

Now your widget should be visible on the dashboard!

### Preventing users from accessing the dashboard

The package also provides easy functionality to prevent the users from accessing the dashboard. In order to force a user to complete a track, you can chain the `->completeBeforeAccess()` to the track:

```php
Track::make([
    Step::make(name: 'Connect Notion', identifier: 'widget::connect-notion')
        ->description('Sign in with Notion and grant access to your workspace.')
        ->icon('heroicon-o-check-circle')
        ->performStepActionLabel('Add workspace →')
        ->url(route('callbacks.notion.authorize'))
        ->completeIf(fn () => auth()->user()->workspaces()->exists())
        ->columnSpan(1),
    // Other steps
    // Onboard::addStep(/** */)...
    // Onboard::addStep(/** */)...
])
->completeBeforeAccess()
```

Next, you should register a middleware. Open your panel service providers and add the middleware to the `authMiddleware()`. The middleware should be after/below the `Authenticate` middelware.
```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Http\Middleware\OnboardMiddleware;

$panel
    ->authMiddleware([
        Authenticate::class,
        OnboardMiddleware::class, // Add here.
    ])
```

Now, whenever a user visits a page and there is still a track with uncompleted steps, they will be automatically redirected to a page where they can complete that step.

#### Custom url when completing before access (NEW)

By default, this page will have the url path "/filament/onboard". You can change this url by providing a different prefix to the `->prefix()` method when configuring the plugin:

```php
$plugin
    // This is the route prefix that will be used for the route(s) in the package.
    // Currently, there is only one route, but this prefix would also be used for
    // new routes if new routes would ever be added.
    ->prefix('welcome')
```

#### Forcing a user to visit a link

If you want your users to visit a url, e.g. for an OAuth app, you can use the exact same syntax as described earlier, without any changes.

#### Adding wizards

If you want your user to complete a wizard, you can use the `->wizard(/** Your wizard steps */)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step as WizardStep;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Step;

Step::make('Your title', 'onboard::unique-identifier')
    ->wizard([
        WizardStep::make("Your label")
            ->statePath('step_1') // It is recommended to keep the form data in a separate array key for each step. 
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required(),
                Select::make('plan_id')
                    ->options([
                        'default' => 'Regular',
                        'pro' => 'Pro',
                        'unlimited' => 'Unlimited'
                    ])
                    ->required(),
                // More components...
            ])    
            // More steps...
    ])
```

> NB. The example import the steps for the wizard using `Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step as WizardStep`. Otherwise, it would collide with the `RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Step`. The actual class name is still `Step`.

For all the `Step` configuration options (adding an icon and description), see the [Filament documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/layout/wizard).

#### Pre-filling the wizard form with data

You can use the `->wizardFillFormUsing()` method to specify data that will be pre-filled into the form. For example, this is useful if you want to retrieve information about an existing record.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step as WizardStep;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Step;

Step::make('Your title', 'onboard::unique-identifier')
    ->wizard([
        WizardStep::make("Your label")
            ->statePath('step_1') // It is recommended to keep the form data separate for each step.
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required(),
                // ...
            ])
            // ...
    ]) 
    ->wizardFillFormUsing(function() {
        return [
            'step_1' => [
                'name' => auth()->user()->name,
                // ...
            ],
            'step_2' => [
                // ...
            ]
        ];
    })         
```

#### Saving the data on form submit

You can use the `->wizardSubmitFormUsing()` method to pass a closure that will be executed when a user submits a form. The closure receives two parameters:

1. `array $state`. An array of the submitted form data. The data is already validated.
2. `\RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Http\Livewire\Wizard $livewire`. The Livewire component that is used to render the wizard.

You can omit one of the parameters if you don't need it, but make sure to always use the parameter names `$state` and `$livewire`. Dependency injection is also supported.

Usually you will use this closure to save the data and then redirect. It is handy to redirect the user to the `filament.pages.dashboard` route, because if there are no steps left, the user will be redirected to the dashboard. And if there still are steps to complete, the middleware will automatically pick that up and redirect the user to the next step.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step as WizardStep;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Step;

Step::make('Your title', 'onboard::unique-identifier')
    ->wizard([
        WizardStep::make("Your label")
            ->statePath('step_1') // It is recommended to keep the form data separate for each step.
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required(),
                // ...
            ])
            // ...
    ])
    ->wizardFillFormUsing(function() {
        // ...
    })
    ->wizardSubmitFormUsing(function(array $state, \RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Http\Livewire\Wizard $livewire) {
        auth()->user()->update($state['step_1']);
        // ...
        
        $livewire->redirectRoute('filament.pages.dashboard');
    })))         
```

#### Customizing the Wizard "submit" button

You can customize the "submit" button in the wizard by using the `->wizardSubmitButton("Your label")` method.

#### Marking the wizard as completed

Don't forget the use the `->completeIf()` method to specify when the wizardstep has been completed. Otherwise, your users might be locked into the wizard forever.

```php
->completeIf(fn () => user()->plan_id !== null)
```

#### Changing the card width

You can use the `->cardWidth()` method to specify how wide the link or wizard should be rendered.

Possible values are: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`.

### Customizing the redirect

By default, the package redirects the user to the admin dashboard after successfully completing the onboarding flow. However, you may customize the route that it used using the `$plugin->redirectRoute()`.

> Make sure to add a *route* and not a url. Inputting a url won't work, only routes do.

```php
$plugin
    ->redirectRoute('some-custom-route')
```

### Advanced complete onboarding example

Below you can find a complete and more advanced onboarding example. This example is also used in the application from the [screenshots](#screenshots) above.

The below code is used to generate the cards in the onboarding widget:

```php
Track::make([
    Step::make('Create list', 'widget::create-list')
        ->description("Create a list to gather your subscribers.")
        ->performStepActionLabel('Create list')
        ->url(fn () => ListResource::getUrl('create'))
        ->icon('tabler-list-check')
        ->columnSpan(2)
        ->completeIf(fn () => auth()->user()->workspaces()->exists()),
    Step::make('Connect Notion', 'widget::connect-notion')
        ->description("Sign in with Notion and grant access to your workspace.")
        ->performStepActionLabel('Add workspace →') 
        ->url(route('callbacks.notion.authorize'))
        ->icon('tabler-brand-notion')
        ->columnSpan(2)
        ->completeIf(fn () => auth()->user()->workspaces()->exists()),
    Step::make('Embed form on site', 'widget::embed-form')

### Upgrading from V1 to V2

The Filament Onboarding plugin has a V2 version that already has support for Filament V3.

If you want to upgrade to Onboarding Manager V2, and therefore Filament V3 support, take the following steps:

- Require `ralphjsmit/laravel-filament-onboard` `'^2.0'` instead of a 1.x version.
- For each of the panels that you want to use the Onboard plugin in, please register the plugin like follows:
    ```php
    use RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\FilamentOnboard;
    
    $panel
        ->plugin(FilamentOnboard::make()) 
    ```             
- Filament V3 offers plugins the ability to be customized per panel. This means that instead of global config values that apply to all panels, you can now set different values per panel. If you want, review the `config/filament-onboard.php` configuration file. Set the values that you want to change using the methods on the `FilamentOnboard` class. The methods look very similar to the keys they had in the config. For example, the key `redirect-route` has become a method `FilamentMediaLibrary::make()->redirectRoute()`. You can also choose to do nothing. The package will retain compatibility with your current config. Whilst we do recommend to stay up-to-date and migrate your config, it is not a stricty requirement. An example plugin configuration could look like:
```php
    $panel
        ->plugin(
            FilamentOnboard::make()
                ->redirectRoute('some-route-name')
                ->prefix('welcome')
                // ..
        ) 
``` 
- Replace all code referring `Onboard::addTrack()` and `Onboard::make()->addTrack()` with `RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Track::make()`. The `Onboard` facade has been removed.
- Replace all code referring `Onboard::addStep()` and `Onboard::make()->addStep()` with `RalphJSmit\Filament\Onboard\Step::make()`. The `Onboard` facade has been removed.
- Previously, all tracks were registered in the `boot()` method of a service provider which you could choose. Now, the logic for registering tracks has moved into the panel service providers. That has the benefit that you can now register different tracks per panel. For a example, a different onboarding track in your admin panel than the track for your normal users. For upgrading, it means that you will need to copy the code that you previously had as `Onboard::addTrack()`, and update it to use the `$plugin->addTrack()` method. You will also need to create the track using `Track::make()`:
```php
    $panel
        ->plugin(
            FilamentOnboard::make()
                ->addTrack(fn () => Track::make([
                    Step::make(/** */),
                    // Other steps...
                ])
                    ->completeBeforeAccess(/** */),
                    // Other methods on the Track...
                )
                // ..
        ) 
```
- Please make sure that you are registering the track inside `->addTrack()` using a closure: `fn () => Track::make()`. If you register it without a closure, it will throw an error.
- If you have extended components like the `Track`, `TrackCollection`, `Step` or `StepCollection`, please check your custom overrides with the new code. The best is to publish your views again.
               
The V2 is available to all customers who previously purchased a license for V1.
