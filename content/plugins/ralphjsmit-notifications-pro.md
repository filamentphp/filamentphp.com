This package allows you to integrate Laravel-notifications in your Filament Admin application. The primary goal is to support the regular Notification system with classes, as [how it is described in the Laravel-docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/notifications). The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to create notification classes that can be sent via multiple channel. For example, send the notification to a user via email ánd show it in the admin panel.

**New: Package includes Filament V3 support!**

[**Upgrading from V1 to V2?**](#upgrading-from-v1-to-v2)

### Features

- Integrates with the Notification-classes from Laravel.
- Send notifications using multiple channels, including the database.
- Custom resource for admin users to send, view and delete notifications.
- Send on demand notifications to one or multiple recipients with a custom message.
- GitHub-inspired page in the admin panel for your users to view notifications.
- Mark notifications as read.
- Mark notifications as done.
- Bookmark notifications.
- Easily extensible.
- Fully translatable.
- Beautiful in dark mode 🌚
- Magically store database notifications in the database, never have to use the `toArray()` method anymore!
- Support for notification actions, icons, descriptions
- Sending simple on demand notifications from code

## Installation

### Prerequisites

For these installation instructions to work, you'll need to have the [Filament Admin](https://filament-admin.com) package installed and configured.


The package is supported on both Laravel 8 and 9. Please be aware though that support for security fixes for Laravel 8 ends within a few months.

### Installation via Composer

To install the package you should add the package to your `composer.json` file in the `repositories` key:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://filament-notifications-pro.composer.sh"
    }
  ],
}

```

Next, you should require the package via the command line. You will be prompted for your username (which is your e-mail) and your password (which is your license key plus a colon ':' + the domain on which you activated it, e.g. `8c21df8f-6273-4932-b4ba-8bcc723ef500:mydomain.com`).

```shell
composer require ralphjsmit/laravel-filament-notifications
```

After purchasing the plugin, you'll also be shown installation instructions with the appropriate credentials pre-filled.

Finally, you'll need to publish the migration and migrate the database:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-notifications-migrations"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-notifications-config"

# You can also publish the translations if wanted:
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-notifications-translations"

php artisan migrate
```

### Custom themes

If you are using a custom theme, the package will work out-of-the-box without any necessary changes.

#### Replace `use Notifiable` with `use FilamentNotifiable`

Next, you need to replace the default `Notifiable` trait with the `FilamentNotifiable` trait. You should do this on your User model and on every other model that you want to send notifications to.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Concerns\FilamentNotifiable;

class User extends Model
{
    use FilamentNotifiable;

    // ..
}
```

### Configuring the plugin per-panel (Filament V3)

If you are using the plugin in Filament V3, you should register the plugin in each of the panels that you have in your project and would like to use the media library in:

```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\FilamentNotifications;

$panel
    ->plugin(FilamentNotifications::make()) 
```

## Usage

### Notifications resource

The Filament Notifications plugin comes with a pre-defined resource that allows you to give your admin users a way to send and manage notifications. By default, this `NotificationResource` is registered automatically. You can disable the automatic registering by removing the resource from the `filament-notifications.register.resources` array in the config.

#### Only giving admin users access

It is recommended to create a new class in your project that extends the default `NotificationResource`. This allows you to customize the label, the navigation group and restrict access for certain users (among other things). By default the resource will have the label `Notifications` and be registered under a navigation group with the name `admin`.

There are two options for restricting access:

1. Block everyone except admins.
2. Use a policy for more fine-grained access.

#### Block everyone except admins

To block access for everyone except admins, you can use the following code:

```php
class NotificationResource extends \RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Filament\Resources\NotificationResource
{
    public static function can(string $action, ?Model $record = null): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()->isAdmin();
    }
    
    public static function shouldRegisterNavigation(): bool
    {
        return static::can('view');
    }    
}
```

#### Block access via a policy

To block access via a policy, you should register a dedicated policy for the `RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Models\DatabaseNotification`-model. A policy for this model is automatically observed by Filament.

### Sending new notifications

If you haven't already done so, you should set up [database notifications in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/notifications#database-notifications). In order to get up and running with database notifications, you should follow the next steps:

1. Add the `database` delivery channel to the `via()` method of your notification.
2. Implement the `AsFilamentNotification` interface and the `toFilamentNotification()` method. You'll learn more about the configuration options in the next section.
3. Add the `StoresNotificationInDatabase` trait to your notification class if you are only using this for database notifications. This trait will take care of converting the object properties to an array for storage in the database, so you don't have to do so.
4. Register the notification in the `filament-notifications.notifications` config array.

```php

namespace App\Notifications;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Contracts\AsFilamentNotification;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\FilamentNotification;

class TestNotification extends Notification implements AsFilamentNotification
{
    use StoresNotificationInDatabase;
    
    public function __construct() 
    {
        //
    }
   
    public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
    {
        return FilamentNotification::make();
    }

    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['database'];
    }
}
```

This is how the configuration file looks:

```php
    'notifications' => [
        // Add the notification classes that your users are allowed to send.
        TestNotification::class
    ],
```

If you want to use a custom label instead of the classname, you can specify the classes as `class => label` pairs:

```php
    'notifications' => [
        // Add the notification classes that your users are allowed to send.
        TestNotification::class => 'My custom label'
    ],
```

### Specifying notifiables

Next, you should register the classes that have the Laravel `Notifiable` trait. Those are the classes that can receive notifications. By default, we included the `\App\Models\User::class`, but you can add more. You can [read more about notifiables in the Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/notifications#using-the-notifiable-trait).

Again, you can specify an array of class names or use the `class => label` convention:

```php
    'notifiables' => [
        'classes' => [
            // The models that can receive notifications.
            \App\Models\User::class,
        ],

        'title-attributes' => [
            // A display-friendly attribute that should be used in the NotificationResource to display each record.
            \App\Models\User::class => 'name',
        ],
    ],
```

After registering a notifiable model, your users will be able to send notifications to that notifiable model. In this example, to one or multiple users.

Because your admin users will need to select notifiable records, you should specify the title record attribute that we will use to display each record:

### Magically storing notifications in the database

It can very well be that your notification needs some parameters and has certain properties that need to be stored in the database. Laravel gives you a handy `toArray()` method that you can use to convert the data on your notification class to an array, which Laravel stores in the database.

However, this process can be a little bit cumbersome, for example because you have to convert Eloquent models to id's and back.

Luckily, this package provides a handy trait called `StoresNotificationInDatabase` that will take care of converting all the data to an array and back, so you don't have to do this cumbersome process yourself.

Below is a (rather far-fetched) example that shows you all the different kinds of properties that are supported.

```php
class TestNotification extends Notification implements AsFilamentNotification
{
    use Queueable, StoresNotificationInDatabase;

    protected array $options;

    protected string $identifier;

    private $private;

    /** Will be stored in the database as null, because untyped & uninitialized properties will never throw a "property not initialized"-exception. */
    public $undefined;

    /** Will not be stored in the database, since it is typed and undefined. */
    public string $undefinedTyped;

    public function __construct(
        protected User $user,
        public string $message,
        array $options,
    ) {
        $this->options = $options;
        $this->identifier = Str::random();
        $this->private = false;
    }

    public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
    {
        //
    }

    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['database'];
    }
}
```

#### Overriding the storing of notifications in the database

However, if the `StoresNotificationInDatabase` doesn't work for you, you can always omit the trait and implement the `toArray()` method yourself. However, doing so also requires that you pass a closure to the `constructUsing()` method on the `FilamentNotification` class, that will take the inputs from the `toArray()` method and return an instantiated notification class using your custom logic:

```php
class TestNotification extends Notification implements AsFilamentNotification
{
    public function __construct(
        public User $user,
        public string $message,
    ) {}
    
    public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
    {
        return FilamentNotification::make()
            ->form([
                \Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput::make('message')
                    ->label('Message')
                    ->required(),
                \Filament\Forms\Components\Select::make('user_id_or_something')
                    ->options(User::get()->mapWithKeys(fn(User $user) => [$user->id => $user->name]))
                    ->required()
                    ->label('User'),
            ])
            ->constructUsing(function(array $data) {
                ['message' => $message, 'user_id_or_something' => $userId] = $data;

                return new static(
                    user: User::find($userId), 
                    message: $message
                );
            });
    }
    
    public function toArray(): array
    {
        return [
            'user_id_or_something' => $this->user->id,
            'message' => $this->message,
        ];
    }
    
    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['database', 'mail'];
    }
}
```

### Displaying notifications to the end-user

By default, the plugin will register a page called "Notifications" as a user menu item.

You can disable this by removing the Notification page class from the `filament-notifications.register.pages` config.

#### Adding a message

Each database notification should be able to be displayed as a string to the end user. In order to achieve this, you should pass a closure or string to the `message()` method in the `toFilamentNotification()` method.

This closure accepts a single argument, with the type and signature`self $notification`.

```php
public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
{
    return FilamentNotification::make()
        ->form(/** */)
        ->message(function (self $notification) {
            return "{$notification->user->name} said: {$notification->message}.";
        });
}
```

#### Adding a notification description

You can also add a description to the notification. This is displayed below or above the notification message and can be used to display more information.

```php
public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
{
    return FilamentNotification::make()
        ->form(/** */)
        ->message("Account has changed")
        ->description(fn(self $notification) => "The user {$notification->user->name} has changed their account.", descriptionPosition: 'below'); // descriptionPosition is "below" or "above".
}
```

#### Adding an icon

It is nice to add a custom icon for every notification. By default, we are using the `heroicon-o-bell`-icon, but you can specify your own icon and icon color using the `->icon()` method.

Both parameters (`$icon` and `$color`) can be both a string and a closure:

```php
return FilamentNotification::make()
    ->form(/** */)
    ->message(/** */)
    ->icon('heroicons-o-check-circle', 'success');
```

You can disable the icon by passing `null` to the first parameter, but that will not look very nice.

#### Adding actions

You can also specify one or more actions that a user can take for a notification. Each action will be shown in the dropdown at the end of each notification:


```php
return FilamentNotification::make()
    ->form(/** */)
    ->message(/** */)
    ->actions([
        Action::make('View')
            ->url("https://github.com", true)
            ->icon('heroicon-o-arrows-expand'),
    ]);
```

### Sending on-demand notifications to users

In the UI, it is possible to send on-demand notifications to one or multiple users. This is very useful for situations where you want to notify a user about something manually, so you don't have to create and maintain a notification class for it.

You can also send these on-demand notifications from code. Here is an example:

```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Notifications\OnDemandNotification;

OnDemandNotification::make('Test')
  ->body('Some nice body')
  ->icon('heroicon-o-information-circle') // You pass any Blade icon-component here.
  ->iconColor('warning')                  // Primary, warning, danger
  ->sendToDatabase($notifiable);          // Can be an Eloquent model or a collection of models.
```

### Complete example

Below is a complete example of a notification that is stored in the database. This example is also visible in the [screenshots](#screenshots) above.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Admin\Notifications;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Concerns\InteractsWithFilamentNotification;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Concerns\StoresNotificationInDatabase;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\Contracts\AsFilamentNotification;
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\FilamentNotification;

class TestWorkflowFailedNotification extends Notification implements AsFilamentNotification
{
    use Queueable;
    use StoresNotificationInDatabase;

    public function __construct(
        public string $repository,
        public string $branch,
    ) {}

    public static function toFilamentNotification(): FilamentNotification
    {
        return FilamentNotification::make()
            ->form([
                TextInput::make('repository')
                    ->label('Repository')
                    ->required(),
                TextInput::make('branch')
                    ->label('Branch')
                    ->required(),
            ])
            ->message(fn (self $notification) => "Test workflow failed for {$notification->branch}")
            ->description(fn (self $notification) => $notification->repository, 'above')
            ->icon('heroicon-o-x-circle', 'danger')
            ->actions([
                Action::make('View')
                    ->url("https://github.com", true)
                    ->icon('heroicon-o-arrows-expand'),
            ]);
    }

    public function toMail($notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return ( new MailMessage )
            ->line("Test workflow failed for {$this->branch}")
            ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['database', 'mail'];
    }
}
```

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

The Filament Notifications Pro plugin has a V2 version that already has support for Filament V3.

If you want to upgrade to Notifications Pro V2, and therefore Filament V3 support, take the following steps:

- Require `ralphjsmit/laravel-filament-notifications` `'^2.0'` instead of a 1.x version.
- For each of the panels that you want to use the Notifications Pro plugin in, please register the plugin like follows:
```php
use RalphJSmit\Filament\Notifications\FilamentNotifications;

$panel
    ->plugin(FilamentNotifications::make()) 
```
- If you have extended pages like the `Notifications` page, please check your custom overrides with the new code. The `Notifications` has dropped several methods like `getTableFilters()`, which has been replaced by a static function `table(Table $table): Table` and `$table->filters()`.
- Re-compile your assets using `npm run build` or `npm run prod` if you are using a custom theme.
