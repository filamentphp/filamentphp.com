## Another major version?

That's right! This year, at the first ever wire:live conference,
Dan unveiled and tagged the first version of Filament's v5 beta!

Now, before you start worrying about having to go through _another_
major version upgrade, don't fret! Filament v5, while a major version
in name, doesn't actually include any new functionality or changes to
existing Filament functionality, so it should be a _very_ easy upgrade.

So if everything within Filament is exactly the same, why then are
we releasing a major version? In short, it all boils down to the release
of Livewire v4. The jump from Livewire v3 to v4 is packed with some
incredible new features, and we want to make use of them within Filament
(and enable folks _using_ Filament to use them as well). However, it
felt imprudent to bump one of our core dependencies to a new major
version in a minor or patch version of Filament itself. Instead,
we decided to go ahead and make the leap to Filament v5!

This does mean that Filament v4 will _not_ include support for Livewire v4;
if you want to use the newest, latest goodies that the Livewire team has
cooked up, you'll need to make the quick and easy jump to Filament v5.

## But wait, there's more

You didn't think we were just going to launch a new major
version without _anything_ else, did you?

While we've been hard at work ensuring that Filament v5 was updated
to make use of all of the fun new Livewire v4 features, we have
had a few other projects bubbling around in the background as well.
We aren't _quite_ ready to announce what we've been working on yet,
but watch this space, because we all think it's really cool.

to offer!
