Hi, I’m **[Srinath](https://dudi.dev)** — a software engineer and product builder passionate about creating tools that make developers’ lives easier. 
I’ve been working with Laravel for years, building open-source packages and performance-focused tools to help teams 
ship better software faster. Through my work at **[BinaryBuilds](https://github.com/binarybuilds/)**, I focus on 
crafting reliable, developer-friendly solutions that simplify complex workflows and boost productivity.
