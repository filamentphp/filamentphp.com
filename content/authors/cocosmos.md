I'm a passionate full-stack developer from Switzerland with extensive experience in building modern web and mobile applications. I specialize in Laravel and Filament, creating tools that enhance developer productivity and improve user experiences. My work spans across React, Vue.js, Next.js, and TypeScript on the frontend, while leveraging Laravel's ecosystem on the backend. I'm an active contributor to the open-source community, focusing on creating practical solutions that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharing knowledge with fellow developers.
