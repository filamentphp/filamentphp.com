I'm a Backend Web Developer with a strong foundation in Laravel, RESTful APIs, and full-stack development. Over the years, I have built scalable systems, designed intuitive user experiences, and contributed to a wide range of projects—from rental management systems and blogging platforms to e-commerce and student profiles. I have hands-on experience with Breeze authentication, resource controllers, factories, data seeding, FilamentPHP, Livewire, and modern testing practices.
