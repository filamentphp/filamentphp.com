## About Me

Hey there! I'm just your not so young anymore neighborhood developer,
passionate about tech, people, experience and turning ideas and code into cool stuff. 
I love tinkering with new technologies and building things that (hopefully) make people's lives a little easier or more interesting.

### What I Do
I spend my days crafting code, solving problems, and occasionally battling with stubborn bugs üêõ. 
My favorite languages/technologies include:

* PHP
* Laravel
* Prestashop
* Wordpress
* Filament
* Livewire
* HTML & CSS
* JavaScript

### When I'm Not Coding
When I step away from the keyboard, I like to travel anywhere in the world

* https://github.com/geimsdin (I 99% use the private company git)

P.S. I'm always up for a good chat about tech, or anything else that sparks your interest!
