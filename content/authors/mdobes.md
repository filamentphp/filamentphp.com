I am a web and application programmer. Currently, I focus primarily on the development of web and desktop applications, API interfaces, and web presentations. My favorite programming languages include PHP (especially the Laravel framework) and JavaScript, or TypeScript. In my free time, I enjoy watching a good TV series or movie.
