I'm a full-stack developer specializing in PHP and JavaScript, focusing on solving real-world problems through effective processes and technology. I'm a tech-driven individual who loves helping others grow. I have experience across multiple roles. I'm also a fan of cappuccinos and Coke Zero, and I'm always open to a good conversation. Learn more about some of my projects at [my website](https://mwguerra.com).
