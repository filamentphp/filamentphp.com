I published my first website in 2006.

I’m a software developer with experience in Laravel, WordPress, and several JavaScript frameworks. I’m also a university instructor and teach various online courses (https://platzi.com/profes/whoisnegrello/).

Throughout my life, my work has revolved around open-source projects, and that’s why I try to be part of the communities I find interesting, useful, or fun.
